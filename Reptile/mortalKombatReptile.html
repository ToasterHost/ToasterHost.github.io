Reptile is a lizard who looks more human-like in some games and more reptilian in others. He was a secret character in the first Mortal Kombat game, and was fully playable in the second. At first, he fought using moves from both Sub-Zero 
and Scorpion, but was given his own move set in the MKII. Reptile has the ability to spit corrosive acid and turn completely invisible. His realm called 
"Zaterra" was conquered by the Outworld emperor, most of the Zaterrans were enslaved, but Reptile was trained into a powerful servant.
