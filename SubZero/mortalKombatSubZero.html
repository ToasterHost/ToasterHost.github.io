Sub-Zero is one of the original characters in the first "Mortal Kombat" game, back in 1995. Sub-Zero has the
power of "cryomancy" which is the power to control and generate ice. He uses these powers to make ice weapons, shoot ice balls and much more.
He was a participant in the Mortal Kombat tournament, but was defeated by another named "Scorpion". Later, is younger brother took on the name Sub-Zero 
and swore revenge on Scorpion.
