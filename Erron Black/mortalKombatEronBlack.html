<p>
Erron Black is a new character introduced in "Mortal Kombat X". Black looks like an old west cowboy, wearing a
wide brim hat and wielding revolvers, a rifle or a "tarkatan blade" as a sword. Erron Black is a human assassin for hire, 
he is very patient and will never give up on a contract until he has received the reward. In MKX Erron Black is employed by 
another character "Kotal Khan" who is the emperor of Outworld in MKX.
