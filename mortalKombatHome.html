	<p>Mortal Kombat is a fighting game which has defined the genre. Since the first game in 1995, nine more games have been added to the series.
		Mortal Kombat is famously known for it's "fatalities" which are ways of "finishing off" your opponent after you win the fight. These have 
		always been border pushing graphic and brutal. So much so, that one of the fatalities in the original game is the main reason ESRB, the corporation
		that gives games an age rating, was founded. Never before had games been violent enough for age restriction.

	<h2>Lore</h2>
	
	<p>In the world of the game, there are multiple "realms" or worlds. "Earthrealm", which is our earth, "Nether realm" which is the underworld and 
	"Outworld" which is an alternate universe. "Order realm", "Chaos realm" and "Edenia" also appear throughout the games. The empire of Outworld  "Shao Kahn"
	wanted to conquer Earthrealm so he sent is best soldier there to set up a tournament called "Mortal Kombat"  where each realm's best warriors would come to fight.
	if you won, you would not age for fifty years so you could participate in the next tournament. Once you won ten tournaments in a row, the realm you represented
	would claim Earthrealm.</p>
